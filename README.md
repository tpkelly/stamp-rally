# Data Storage

The Stamp Rally stores data about entrants to the rally, in order to enter them into the raffle at the end. Entrants are only stored the first time they receive a stamp, but can still see their blank stamp `/card` before this point.

Data will be retained until all of the prizes have been distributed, on or after Jan 25th 2025. The only data stored is the Discord ID of the entrant, and a value indicating which stamps they have collected.
